<h2 id="BKUC"><a href="BKUC" style="text-decoration: none; color:black" >Building Kendo UI Core</a> </h2>
<br>

There are two ways to get the source code for Kendo UI Core. You can either download a pre-built zip from [telerik.com](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui/open-source-core) , or build the source yourself using Gulp. The latter approach includes a option for building a distribution of Kendo UI Core that includes only the widgets and framework features required by your app.

<h2 id="uku"><a href="uku" style="text-decoration: none; color:black" >Using Kendo UI Core via the Kendo Static CDN
</a> </h2>
<br>

You can also easily include Kendo UI Core in your site or application by using the Kendo CDN:
```
<link href="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/styles/kendo.common.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/styles/kendo.default.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/js/kendo.ui.core.min.js"></script><link href="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/styles/kendo.common.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/styles/kendo.default.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2014.2.716/js/kendo.ui.core.min.js"></script>
```
The main advantage of the CDN approach is that your users may be able to leverage a primed cache version of Kendo UI Core if they've visited other sites using the framework.
